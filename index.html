                <p>Hi, I'm Austin! I'm a Web Developer who is currently attending UCF's coding Boot Camp! <br>
                    When I'm not coding you can find me exploring Orlando's coffee scene! <br>
                    I also love to travel! I recently visited Peru and hiked up Macchu Picchu! <br>
